# 🧠 Danish's Public Bin Repository

Welcome to my **Public Bin Repo** — a personal collection of reusable code components, scripts, snippets, and small project modules. This is where I drop in helpful files that can be used by **you** — friends, collaborators, and developers who just need quick access to individual resources.
